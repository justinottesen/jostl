# jostl
This project is my implementation of the C++ standard library. This will likely not be useful to anyone but me, and is an exercise to deepen my understanding. It is called jostl because my initials are JO, and I am recreating the C++ stl.

I will not conform exactly to the standard, I do not have the time, energy, or care to maintain that. I may make changes where I see fit.
